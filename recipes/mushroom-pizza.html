    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound fresh pizza dough</li>
        <li>flour for dusting</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>½ pound cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ pound maitake mushrooms, broken into small clusters</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 (5 ounce) package fresh baby spinach</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, grated</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>shaved Pecorino Romano cheese, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put a pizza stone or baking sheet on the middle oven rack. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and roll out into a 14-inch circle. Transfer to a piece of parchment paper or a cookie sheet lightly dusted with flour or cornmeal. Cover with a kitchen towel; let stand at room temperature until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add cremini and maitake mushrooms; cook, stirring occasionally, until well browned and tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in oregano, thyme, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Transfer mushroom mixture to a bowl. (Do not wipe skillet clean.)</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon oil to skillet. Add spinach and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; cook, stirring frequently, until spinach is wilted, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
        <li>Stir together ricotta, Pecorino-Romano, garlic, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper in a bowl until well combined. Brush dough with remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Spread ricotta mixture in an even layer over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border. Sprinkle mozzarella evenly over ricotta mixture. Top with cooked mushrooms and spinach.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer pizza on parchment to hot pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven. Bake until cheese is bubbly and crust is deeply golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer pizza and parchment to a cutting board; let stand 5 minutes. Remove parchment. Garnish with additional thyme, a few grinds of pepper, and shaved Pecorino-Romano cheese.</li>
    </ol>
